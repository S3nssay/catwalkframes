For CONVERSATIONAL queries (greetings, thanks, help, questions about areas, council tax, transport, local amenities, neighborhood characteristics): return intent "conversation"
For PROPERTY SEARCH queries (looking for specific properties with "show me", "find", "search"): return intent "property_search" with filters

IMPORTANT: Only treat queries as property searches when they explicitly want to see/find properties. Questions about areas, council tax, transport, etc. are conversational.
